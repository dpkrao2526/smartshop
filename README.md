Theme Chosen
Gen AI â€“ Generative Artificial Intelligence in RETAIL

Our chosen theme, Gen AI, plays a pivotal role in our visionary e-commerce platform.

Problem Statement
In today's digital landscape, the abundance of choices available to consumers has rendered the process of selecting the right product a daunting and complex task. The relentless influx of information and options often plunges individuals into a state of confusion, where making a well-informed decision becomes increasingly challenging. This information overload not only hampers the decision-making process but also contributes to a prevailing sense of buyer's remorse, as consumers struggle to discern the most suitable products amidst the overwhelming array of alternatives. Thus, addressing this issue has become imperative, as simplifying and enhancing the decision-making journey for consumers is vital in navigating the modern marketplace effectively.

Proposed Solution
We are poised to revolutionize online shopping by harnessing cutting-edge technologies. Our solution begins with data gathering via advanced web scraping and meticulous data refinement from various e-commerce sources. This process lays the foundation for a seamless shopping experience.
The heart of our solution lies in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), which classifies customer reviews and thus provides valuable guidance to shoppers, making their decisions more informed and confident.
But what truly sets our platform apart is the innovative use of Gen AI. This transformative feature elevates user engagement by offering concise and insightful summaries of customer reviews. Users can effortlessly grasp sentiments, streamlining the decision-making process.
In an age of information overload and endless product options, Gen AI is the driving force behind our mission to simplify shopping, empower informed choices, and deliver a truly unique and satisfying shopping journey.
